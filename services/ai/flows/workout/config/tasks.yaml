    As a technical coach with expertise in multisport session design and high-performance training, suggest three different workout options for {athlete_name} based on the following data. Your workout suggestions will be presented directly to the athlete, so focus on providing clear, engaging, and actionable training options that align with the competition planning strategy.

    Athlete Context:
    ```json
    {athlete_context}
    ```
    Consider any constraints, preferences, or circumstances provided by the athlete when designing the workouts.

    Training Metrics:
    ```json
    {metrics_data}
    ```

    Activity Data:
    ```json
    {activities_data}
    ```

    Analysis Report:
    ```json
    {analysis_report}
    ```

    Upcoming Competitions:
    ```json
    {competitions}
    ```

    Current Date:
    ```json
    {current_date}
    ```

    Use the training phase plan from the previous task as context to ensure alignment with competition preparation. Design three distinct training options (A, B, C), each focusing on a specific session type that best serves the athlete's current preparation needs and personal preferences.
