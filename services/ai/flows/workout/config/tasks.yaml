    As a technical coach with expertise in multisport session design and high-performance training, suggest three different workout options for {athlete_name} based on the following data. Your workout suggestions will be presented directly to the athlete, so focus on providing clear, engaging, and actionable training options that align with the competition planning strategy.

    Athlete Context:
    ```json
    {athlete_context}
    ```

    Metrics Analysis:
    ```json
    {metrics_analysis}
    ```

    Physiology Analysis:
    ```json
    {physiology_analysis}
    ```

    Current Date:
    ```json
    {current_date}
    ```

    Use the activity context and training phase plan from the previous tasks as context to ensure alignment with the athlete's current status and competition preparation. Consider all available analysis results to optimize the workout design:
    - Training load and performance trends from metrics analysis
    - Recovery state and readiness from physiology analysis
    - Any specific constraints or preferences from athlete context

    Design three distinct training options (A, B, C), each focusing on a specific session type that best serves the athlete's current preparation needs and personal preferences.

  expected_output: >
    Three distinct training options (A, B, C) for today, each presenting a complete session design that aligns with the athlete's current status and competition goals. Each option should focus on the most beneficial type of training for today, whether that's a discipline-specific session, brick workout, strength training, or recovery.
