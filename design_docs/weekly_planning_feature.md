# Weekly Planning Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

The weekly planning feature will allow users to generate a comprehensive training plan for the upcoming week. The plan will include detailed workouts for each day, considering the user's race schedule, training history, physiological data, and any custom requirements they provide.

## System Architecture

The weekly planning feature will integrate with the existing system as follows:

1. A new command handler for `/weekplan` will be added
2. A conversation handler will collect user context
3. A new AI flow will generate the weekly plan
4. The plan will be delivered as an HTML document

## Implementation Components

### 1. Command Handler

Add a new command handler in `bot/handlers/command_handlers.py` for the `/weekplan` command that will trigger the weekly planning conversation flow.

### 2. Conversation Handler

Create a new conversation handler in `bot/handlers/conversation_handlers.py` for the weekly planning flow that will:
- Ask for user context/customization
- Process the input
- Generate the weekly plan
- Deliver the HTML report

### 3. Weekly Planning Flow

Create a new flow in `services/ai/flows/weekly_plan/weekly_plan_flow.py` that will:
- Analyze training context
- Generate a weekly plan
- Format the plan as HTML

### 4. Update AI Settings

Update `services/ai/ai_settings.py` to add a new agent role for the weekly planner.

### 5. Update Flows Package

Update `services/ai/flows/__init__.py` to include the new flow.

### 6. Update Bot Registration

Update `bot/bot.py` to register the new conversation handler.

### 7. Update Start Command

Update the start command to include the weekly plan button.
