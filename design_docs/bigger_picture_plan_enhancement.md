# Enhanced Weekly Planning Feature - Simplified Approach

## Overview

This document outlines a simplified approach to enhance the weekly planning feature with:

1. A high-level seasonal planning component integrated directly into the weekly plan flow
2. Extension to a two-week plan instead of a one-week plan
3. Streamlined workout details to keep the output manageable

## Key Changes

### 1. Integrated Season Planning Agent

Instead of creating a separate command and flow for season planning, we'll add a seasonal planning agent directly to the weekly plan flow. This agent will:

- Generate a high-level season plan (~12-24 weeks) with each weekly plan request
- Provide context for the two-week plan that follows
- Eliminate the need for separate storage or invalidation mechanisms

### 2. Two-Week Planning

The current weekly plan will be extended to cover two weeks instead of one, with:
- Slightly reduced detail level to keep the overall output manageable
- Clear connection to the seasonal context
- Appropriate adaptation options

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Update the WeeklyPlanState

```python
class WeeklyPlanState(BaseModel):
    """State management for weekly planning flow."""
    training_context: str = ""
    season_plan: str = ""  # New field for high-level season plan
    two_week_plan: str = ""  # Renamed from weekly_plan
    html_result: str = ""
```

### 2. Enhanced WeeklyPlanCrew

Add a new agent to the existing WeeklyPlanCrew:

```python
@agent
def season_planner_agent(self) -> Agent:
    """Create season planning agent."""
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config['season_planner_agent'],
        llm=ModelSelector.get_llm(AgentRole.SEASON_PLANNER)  # New role
    )

@task
def season_plan_task(self) -> Task:
    """Create season planning task."""
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config['season_plan_task'],
        context=[self.training_context_task()]  # Use training context as input
    )

@task
def weekly_plan_task(self) -> Task:
    """Create two-week planning task."""
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config['weekly_plan_task'],
        context=[self.training_context_task(), self.season_plan_task()]  # Use both tasks as context
    )

@task
def formatter_task(self) -> Task:
    """Create formatter task."""
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config['formatter_task'],
        context=[self.weekly_plan_task()]  # This already includes the other tasks indirectly
    )

@crew
def season_planner_crew(self) -> Crew:
    """Create season planner crew."""
    return Crew(
        agents=[self.season_planner_agent()],
        tasks=[self.season_plan_task()],
        process=Process.sequential
    )
```

### 3. Update Weekly Plan Flow

Modify the flow to incorporate the seasonal planning step and extend to two weeks:

```python
class EnhancedWeeklyPlanFlow(Flow[WeeklyPlanState]):
    """Enhanced weekly planning flow with integrated season planning."""
    
    # [existing initialization code]
    
    @start()
    async def analyze_training_context(self):
        """Analyze training context."""
        # Similar to existing implementation, but calculate two-week dates
        try:
            # Load cached analysis results
            # [existing code]
            
            # Calculate the two-week period dates instead of one week
            current_date = datetime.now()
            two_week_dates = []
            for i in range(14):  # 14 days instead of 7
                day = current_date + timedelta(days=i)
                two_week_dates.append({
                    'date': day.isoformat(),

                }
            )

### 4. Configuration Updates

#### AI Settings Update

```python
# In services/ai/ai_settings.py

class AgentRole(str, Enum):
    """Agent roles for different types of tasks."""
    # Existing roles...
    SEASON_PLANNER = "season_planner"  # New role
```

#### New Season Planner Agent Config

```yaml
# Add to services/ai/flows/weekly_plan/config/agents.yaml

season_planner_agent:
  role: Coach Magnus Thorsson - Season Strategist
  goal: |
    Create a high-level training plan covering the next 12-24 weeks that provides
    periodization structure and training phases leading up to key competitions.
  backstory: |
    Coach Magnus Thorsson is a legendary ultra-endurance champion from Iceland who now 
    coaches remotely from his mountain cabin near ReykjavÃ­k. After winning the Arctic 
    Ultra five times and setting records in events across all seven continents, Magnus 
    developed the "Thorsson Method" of periodization that's now used by world champions 
    in multiple endurance disciplines.
    
    Magnus grew up in a small fishing village where his father taught him that "the sea 
    doesn't care about your schedule" - a philosophy he applies to training: the body's 
    readiness dictates the work, not the calendar. His approach combines old-world 
    intuition with modern science, creating training plans that feel almost mystically 
    attuned to an athlete's needs.
    
    As a seasonal planner, Magnus excels at:
    - Designing progressive training phases based on race goals
    - Balancing workload and recovery across macro-cycles
    - Creating season-long intensity progressions
    - Building confidence through strategic fitness milestones
```

#### Season Planning Task Config

    ## Your Task
    Create a high-level season plan that provides a framework for the next 12-24 weeks of training, leading up to key competitions. This should be concise yet informative, focusing on:

    1. PLAN OVERVIEW: A brief summary of the season plan structure and progression
    2. TRAINING PHASES: Define 3-5 key training phases with approximate date ranges
    3. PHASE DETAILS: For each phase, provide:
       - Primary focus and goals
       - Weekly volume targets (approximate)
       - Intensity distribution
       - Key workout types

    For each phase, include a brief table showing:
    - Weeks covered (e.g., "Weeks 1-4: May 6 - June 2")
    - Weekly volume range
    - Primary focus
    - Key workout types

    KEEP THIS CONCISE! This is a high-level plan that will contextualize a more detailed two-week plan.
    
    Format your response as a structured markdown document with clear headings and bullet points.

# Update the existing weekly plan task to generate a two-week plan

weekly_plan_task:
  name: two_week_plan_generation
  description: >
    You are Coach Magnus Thorsson, a legendary ultra-endurance champion from Iceland who developed the "Thorsson Method" of periodization. Based on Dr. Chen's training context analysis and your season plan, create a detailed 14-day training plan.

    ## Athlete Information
    - Name: {athlete_name}
    - Current Date: {current_date}
    - Upcoming Two Weeks: {week_dates}
    - Upcoming Competitions: {competitions}
    - Custom User Instructions: {athlete_context}

    ## Analysis Information
    {training_context_task}

    ## Season Plan
    {season_plan_task}

    ## Your Task
    Create a detailed 14-day training plan that:
    1. Aligns with the current phase in your season plan
    2. Adapts to the athlete's current Training Readiness Score
    3. Provides an appropriate balance of workload and recovery
    
    For each day of the two-week period, provide:

    1. DAY & DATE: The day of the week and date
    2. WORKOUT TYPE: Primary workout type (e.g., Easy Run, Interval Session, etc.)
    3. PURPOSE: The purpose of this workout within the training plan
    4. STRUCTURE: A streamlined structure including:
       - Main sets with intensities and durations
       - Key workout parameters
    5. INTENSITY GUIDANCE: Target zones, effort levels, or pace guidelines
    6. ADAPTATION OPTIONS: Brief options for adjusting based on readiness

    Begin with a concise overview of how this two-week block fits within the current training phase.
    
    IMPORTANT: Keep workout details more concise than in a one-week plan, focusing on the most important elements while maintaining enough detail for execution.

    Use the following style guidelines:
    - Clear headings for each day
    - Emojis for key sections
    - Bullet points for clarity
    - Bold text for intensity guidance
  expected_output: >
    A two-week training plan with appropriately detailed workouts for each day,
