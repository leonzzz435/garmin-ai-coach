# Current Task: Enhanced Visual README Design

## Current Objectives

### Primary Goal
Transform the existing README from a technical documentation format into a compelling, narrative-driven presentation that immediately captures attention and demonstrates the project's value.

## Context

### Current README Status
- Solid technical documentation but very technical-focused
- Missing visual elements (screenshots, gifs, badges)
- No immediate "wow factor" for potential users/contributors
- Setup instructions come before demonstrating value

### Target Transformation
- **Narrative-driven**: Hook with compelling story ("Your AI triathlon coach in your pocket")
- **Visual-first**: Screenshots of Telegram conversations and beautiful HTML reports
- **Feature highlights**: Use badges, emojis, and bullet points for instant scanning
- **Demo before setup**: Show the magic before explaining how to use it
- **Developer-friendly**: Keep technical details but push them lower

## Current Implementation Status

### Available Assets
- `analysis.html` - Beautiful performance analysis reports with charts
- `planning.html` - Structured weekly training plans with visual elements
- Telegram bot interface - Interactive coaching conversations
- CLI interface - Headless configuration-driven operation
- LangGraph architecture - Modern state-based AI workflows

### Next Steps

1. **Analyze Current README** - Review existing content and structure
2. **Explore Visual Assets** - Examine HTML reports and identify screenshot opportunities
3. **Review Architecture Diagrams** - Check existing technical documentation
4. **Design New Structure** - Create compelling narrative flow
5. **Implement New README** - Write engaging, visual-first documentation
6. **Extract Screenshots** - Generate compelling visual demonstrations

## Success Criteria

- README immediately hooks visitors with compelling narrative
- Visual assets demonstrate real value before technical setup
- Maintains developer-friendliness while being accessible
- Technical architecture is preserved but repositioned
- Clear call-to-action for different user types (end users vs developers)
