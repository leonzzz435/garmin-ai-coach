# Current Task: LangGraph Migration Planning

## Current Objectives

### Primary Objective
Migrate the existing agentic flow from LangChain orchestrators to LangGraph to reduce code complexity, improve observability, and enable better workflow management while maintaining all existing AI analysis capabilities.

### Specific Goals for This Phase
1. **Migration Analysis** ✅ - Analyze current LangChain architecture and identify improvement opportunities
2. **LangGraph Research** ✅ - Research LangGraph capabilities, state management, and best practices
3. **Migration Plan Creation** ✅ - Create comprehensive migration strategy and implementation plan
4. **Phase 1 Foundation** ✅ - Complete foundation setup with state schema and LangSmith integration
5. **Documentation Updates** ✅ - Update technical documentation to reflect new architecture
6. **Implementation Preparation** ✅ - Prepare for migration implementation with test coverage

## Context

### Current System Overview
- **Existing Architecture**: Sequential LangChain orchestrators with 800+ lines of coordination code
- **Core Components**: MasterOrchestrator, AnalysisOrchestrator, WeeklyPlanOrchestrator
- **Pain Points**: Custom cost tracking, manual progress management, complex error handling
- **Analysis Pipeline**: 6 sequential agents for training analysis + 4 agents for planning

### Migration Opportunity
- **LangGraph Benefits**: Explicit state management, built-in observability, streaming progress
- **Code Reduction**: Estimated 67% reduction in orchestration complexity
- **Infrastructure**: Replace custom components with LangGraph/LangSmith built-ins
- **Parallel Execution**: Enable concurrent agent execution where appropriate

### User Requirements
- **Functionality**: 100% feature parity with current system
- **Performance**: Maintain or improve current analysis speed
- **Observability**: Enhanced monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Reliability**: Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps

### Phase 1 Completed ✅
1. **Migration Branch Created**
   - ✅ `feature/langgraph-migration` branch established
   - ✅ LangGraph and LangSmith dependencies installed
   - ✅ Complete directory structure: `services/ai/langgraph/{nodes,state,workflows,config}`

2. **Foundation Implementation**
   - ✅ TrainingAnalysisState schema with typed fields and reducers
   - ✅ LangSmith configuration for professional observability
   - ✅ Test coverage with 4/4 passing tests (97% coverage)
   - ✅ Comprehensive node analysis and migration blueprint

### Next Phase: Proof of Concept
1. **Convert Metrics Agent to LangGraph Node**
   - Implement first agent as LangGraph node function
   - Validate approach and state management
   - Test parallel execution capabilities

2. **Basic Workflow Implementation**
   - Create StateGraph with initial node structure
   - Implement checkpointer for persistence
   - Enable LangSmith cost tracking integration

### Dependencies
- **LangGraph Framework**: Latest stable version with state management
- **LangSmith Integration**: Observability and cost tracking setup
- **Existing Analysis Capabilities**: All current AI agents must remain functional
- **Plotting System**: Integration with state-based plot storage

### Success Criteria Achieved ✅
- ✅ Migration branch created with complete LangGraph foundation
- ✅ State schema implemented with reducer support for parallel execution
- ✅ LangSmith integration configured and tested
- ✅ Comprehensive migration blueprint with 79% code reduction plan
- ✅ Test coverage ensuring foundation stability

### Success Criteria for Next Phase
- Single agent (Metrics) successfully converted to LangGraph node
- Basic StateGraph workflow operational
- Parallel execution demonstrated (Metrics + Physiology)
- LangSmith cost tracking integrated and functional
