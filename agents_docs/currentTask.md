# Current Task: LangGraph Migration Planning

## Current Objectives

### Primary Objective
Migrate the existing agentic flow from LangChain orchestrators to LangGraph to reduce code complexity, improve observability, and enable better workflow management while maintaining all existing AI analysis capabilities.

### Specific Goals for This Phase
1. **Migration Analysis** ‚úÖ - Analyze current LangChain architecture and identify improvement opportunities
2. **LangGraph Research** ‚úÖ - Research LangGraph capabilities, state management, and best practices  
3. **Migration Plan Creation** ‚úÖ - Create comprehensive migration strategy and implementation plan
4. **Documentation Updates** üîÑ - Update technical documentation to reflect new architecture
5. **Implementation Preparation** ‚è≥ - Prepare for migration implementation

## Context

### Current System Overview
- **Existing Architecture**: Sequential LangChain orchestrators with 800+ lines of coordination code
- **Core Components**: MasterOrchestrator, AnalysisOrchestrator, WeeklyPlanOrchestrator
- **Pain Points**: Custom cost tracking, manual progress management, complex error handling
- **Analysis Pipeline**: 6 sequential agents for training analysis + 4 agents for planning

### Migration Opportunity
- **LangGraph Benefits**: Explicit state management, built-in observability, streaming progress
- **Code Reduction**: Estimated 67% reduction in orchestration complexity
- **Infrastructure**: Replace custom components with LangGraph/LangSmith built-ins
- **Parallel Execution**: Enable concurrent agent execution where appropriate

### User Requirements
- **Functionality**: 100% feature parity with current system
- **Performance**: Maintain or improve current analysis speed
- **Observability**: Enhanced monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Reliability**: Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Actions
1. **Create Migration Branch**
   - Set up `feature/langgraph-migration` branch
   - Install LangGraph and LangSmith dependencies
   - Configure initial project structure

2. **Proof of Concept Implementation**
   - Convert single agent (Metrics Agent) to LangGraph node
   - Implement basic state schema and graph structure
   - Validate LangSmith integration for cost tracking

3. **Team Preparation**
   - Conduct LangGraph training session
   - Review migration plan with stakeholders
   - Establish testing and validation procedures

### Dependencies
- **LangGraph Framework**: Latest stable version with state management
- **LangSmith Integration**: Observability and cost tracking setup
- **Existing Analysis Capabilities**: All current AI agents must remain functional
- **Plotting System**: Integration with state-based plot storage

### Success Criteria for Next Phase
- Migration branch created with initial LangGraph setup
- Single agent successfully converted to demonstrate approach
- LangSmith integration working for cost and performance monitoring
- Team aligned on migration strategy and timeline
