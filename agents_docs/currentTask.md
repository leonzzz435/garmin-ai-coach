# Current Task: iPhone App Development Planning

## Current Objectives

### Primary Objective
Transform the existing AI triathlon coaching system (currently Telegram-based) into a native iPhone application while maintaining all existing AI analysis capabilities.

### Specific Goals for This Phase
1. **Architecture Design** âœ… - Design hybrid approach with iOS frontend + Python backend API
2. **Technical Specification** âœ… - Define MVP features and implementation approach  
3. **Documentation Creation** âœ… - Create comprehensive development plan and roadmap
4. **Next Phase Preparation** ðŸ”„ - Prepare for backend API development

## Context

### Current System Overview
- **Existing Platform**: Telegram bot with sophisticated AI analysis
- **Core Technology**: Python with LangChain orchestrators
- **AI Capabilities**: Multi-agent system analyzing Garmin training data
- **Data Processing**: Comprehensive extraction from Garmin Connect
- **Analysis Output**: HTML reports with embedded charts/visualizations

### Constraints & Considerations
- **No Garmin OAuth**: Cannot use official Garmin developer APIs
- **Hybrid Approach**: Keep Python backend, build iOS frontend
- **MVP Focus**: Minimal viable product for first version
- **Security**: Maintain existing credential encryption and security measures

### User Requirements
- **Platform**: Native iPhone app
- **Authentication**: Seamless Garmin login experience
- **Core Feature**: Trigger analysis and view formatted reports
- **User Experience**: Simple, clean, focused interface

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Actions
1. **Setup Backend API Structure**
   - Create FastAPI project structure
   - Design API endpoints for authentication and analysis
   - Integrate with existing services (SecureCredentialManager, LangChainFullAnalysisFlow)

2. **Define API Contracts**
   - Authentication flow (login, token management)
   - Analysis orchestration (trigger, status, results)
   - Data models for request/response structures

3. **iOS Project Planning**
   - Choose development approach (SwiftUI vs UIKit)
   - Define app navigation structure
   - Plan data flow between views

### Dependencies
- **Backend API**: Must be completed before iOS development can begin
- **Existing Services**: All current AI analysis capabilities must remain functional
- **Security Layer**: Credential management and encryption must be preserved

### Success Criteria for Next Phase
- Backend API successfully wraps existing Python services
- Authentication flow works end-to-end
- Analysis can be triggered and monitored via API
- API is deployed and accessible for iOS development
