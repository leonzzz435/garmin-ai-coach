# Current Task: LangGraph Migration Planning

## Current Objectives

### Primary Objective
Migrate the existing agentic flow from LangChain orchestrators to LangGraph to reduce code complexity, improve observability, and enable better workflow management while maintaining all existing AI analysis capabilities.

### Specific Goals for This Phase
1. **Migration Analysis** ✅ - Analyze current LangChain architecture and identify improvement opportunities
2. **LangGraph Research** ✅ - Research LangGraph capabilities, state management, and best practices
3. **Migration Plan Creation** ✅ - Create comprehensive migration strategy and implementation plan
4. **Phase 1 Foundation** ✅ - Complete foundation setup with state schema and LangSmith integration
5. **Documentation Updates** ✅ - Update technical documentation to reflect new architecture
6. **Implementation Preparation** ✅ - Prepare for migration implementation with test coverage

## Context

### Current System Overview
- **Existing Architecture**: Sequential LangChain orchestrators with 800+ lines of coordination code
- **Core Components**: MasterOrchestrator, AnalysisOrchestrator, WeeklyPlanOrchestrator
