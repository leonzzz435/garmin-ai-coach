# Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals

### Primary Objective
Transform tele_garmin from a sequential LangChain-based system to a modern, state-driven LangGraph workflow system with built-in observability, parallel execution capabilities, and reduced code complexity.

### Key Features Target
- **Modernized AI Pipeline**: Replace 800+ lines of custom orchestration with ~300 lines of LangGraph StateGraph workflows
- **Built-in Observability**: Professional monitoring via LangSmith dashboards replacing custom cost tracking
- **Parallel Execution**: Enable concurrent processing of independent analysis agents (Metrics + Physiology)
- **Streaming Progress**: Real-time workflow updates without custom callback implementations
- **State Persistence**: Checkpointer-based resumable workflows replacing file-based storage

## Completion Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
- [ ] 60%+ reduction in orchestration code lines (800+ â†’ 300 lines)
- [ ] 100% feature parity with current system functionality
- [ ] <10% performance degradation during migration
- [ ] Real-time progress streaming operational
- [ ] Built-in cost tracking and monitoring via LangSmith
