---

## 💻 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Garmin Connect account (your training data source)
* LLM API key for your chosen provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter)
* Optional: `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` for observability

### Installing Pixi

[Pixi](https://pixi.sh) is a fast, modern package manager for Python projects that simplifies dependency management.

**Install pixi:**

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
iwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

For alternative installation methods (Homebrew, Conda, manual), visit the [official installation guide](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation).

**Verify installation:**

```bash
pixi --version
```

**Set up the project environment:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonzzz435/garmin-ai-coach.git
cd garmin-ai-coach

pixi install
```

This will automatically install all dependencies specified in [`pixi.toml`](pixi.toml:1) and [`pixi.lock`](pixi.lock:1).

### Using Pixi (Recommended)

1. **Create your environment file:**

```bash
# .env (or .env.dev)

# Choose at least one provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_...  # Optional: professional observability

# AI mode default (overridden by config's extraction.ai_mode)
AI_MODE=development
```

**Important: Provider mapping and AI mode**

* If you only set OPENAI_API_KEY, set your config `extraction.ai_mode: "standard"` (this mode maps to an OpenAI model by default), or update the mapping in [`services/ai/ai_settings.py`](services/ai/ai_settings.py:24) within [`python.AISettings()`](services/ai/ai_settings.py:19) so your chosen mode points to an OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-5-mini`).
* The CLI exports `AI_MODE` from your config at [`cli/garmin_ai_coach_cli.py`](cli/garmin_ai_coach_cli.py:126); model IDs are defined in [`python.ModelSelector.CONFIGURATIONS`](services/ai/model_config.py:22), and the provider key is auto-selected in [`python.ModelSelector.get_llm()`](services/ai/model_config.py:61).

2. **Install and run (CLI):**

```bash
pixi run coach-init my_training_config.yaml
pixi run coach-cli --config my_training_config.yaml
```

### Alternative Installation (CLI without Pixi)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cli/garmin_ai_coach_cli.py --init-config my_training_config.yaml
python cli/garmin_ai_coach_cli.py --config my_training_config.yaml
```

## 🎛️ AI Configuration & Models

### AI Modes

Choose your analysis depth and cost balance:

* **`development`** — Fast iterations, cost-effective (7–14 days data)
* **`standard`** — Comprehensive analysis (21–56 days data)
* **`cost_effective`** — Balanced approach for budget-conscious users

### Supported LLM Providers

* **🤖 OpenAI**

  * `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-search` (with web search)
  * `gpt-4.5`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`
  * `o1`, `o1-mini`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`

* **🧠 Anthropic Claude**

  * `claude-4`, `claude-4-thinking`
  * `claude-opus`, `claude-opus-thinking`
  * `claude-3-haiku`

* **🚀 OpenRouter/DeepSeek**

  * `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`

*Configure in [`services/ai/ai_settings.py`](services/ai/ai_settings.py:24) by updating the `stage_models` mapping in [`python.AISettings()`](services/ai/ai_settings.py:19).*

**Important — provider selection depends on your AI mode:**

* Default mapping in [`services/ai/ai_settings.py`](services/ai/ai_settings.py:24):

  * `standard` → `gpt-5` (OpenAI)
  * `development` → `claude-4` (Anthropic)
  * `cost_effective` → `claude-3-haiku` (Anthropic)
* The CLI exports `AI_MODE` from your config’s `extraction.ai_mode` at [`cli/garmin_ai_coach_cli.py`](cli/garmin_ai_coach_cli.py:126).
* If you only set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, use `ai_mode: "standard"` (default maps to an OpenAI model) or update `stage_models` to point your chosen mode to an OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-5-mini`) in [`services/ai/ai_settings.py`](services/ai/ai_settings.py:24). Available model IDs are defined in [`python.ModelSelector.CONFIGURATIONS`](services/ai/model_config.py:22), and the provider is auto-selected in [`python.ModelSelector.get_llm()`](services/ai/model_config.py:61).
* If you only set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, keep `ai_mode: "development"` or `"cost_effective"` (both map to Anthropic by default) or change the mapping.
* If you use OpenRouter (e.g., DeepSeek), map your mode to an OpenRouter model key from [`python.ModelSelector.CONFIGURATIONS`](services/ai/model_config.py:22).

## 📋 Configuration

**Analysis vs Planning context:**

* **Analysis context:** how to interpret past data (e.g., risk tolerance, injury notes, priorities)
* **Planning context:** how to plan future training (e.g., emphasis, constraints, races). This is freeform text interpreted by the AI.

### Minimal config

```yaml
athlete:
  name: "Your Name"
  email: "you@example.com"

context:
  analysis: "Recovering from injury; focus on base building"
  planning: "Olympic triathlon in 12 weeks; build aerobic base"

extraction:
  activities_days: 7
  metrics_days: 14
  ai_mode: "development"   # or "standard" or "cost_effective"
  hitl_enabled: true       # Enable conversational agents (default: true)
  skip_synthesis: false    # Skip synthesis stage to save tokens (default: false)

competitions:
  - name: "Target Race"
    date: "2026-04-15"
    race_type: "Olympic"
    priority: "A"

output:
  directory: "./data"

credentials:
  password: ""   # Leave empty to be prompted securely at runtime
```

### Advanced config (derived from real usage)

```yaml
athlete:
  name: "Athlete Name"
  email: "you@example.com"

context:
  analysis: |
    Completed my first 70.3 recently. Great result but exposed durability gaps
    due to last-minute shoe change. Analyze this multisport activity in detail.

  planning: |
    ## Start Date
    Plan should start on **Monday, xxxx-xx-xx**.

    ## Important Needs
    - Functional Strength, Durability & Triathlon Transfer
      Integrate explicit daily micro-workouts (5–10 min).
      Goals: run economy & lower-leg robustness; bike posture & core transfer; durability & recovery.

    - Shoe Adaptation & Running Technique
      Get used to carbon plate shoes (front-foot style) with targeted technique/strength.

    ## Session Constraints (Shoes)
    - Per-session shoe exclusivity: every run is tagged either `carbon` or `non-carbon`.

    ## Training Preferences
    - No indoor bike trainer available.
    - No swimming for now.

    ## Training Zones
    | Discipline | Base Metric                  |
    |------------|------------------------------|
    | Running    | LTHR ≈ 173 bpm / 4:35 min/km |
    | Cycling    | FTP ≈ 271W                   |
    | Heart Rate | Max HR ≈ 193 bpm             |

    ## Closing
    Provide structured daily checklists to support both athletic and personal goals.

extraction:
  activities_days: 21
  metrics_days: 56
  ai_mode: "standard"
  hitl_enabled: true       # Enable human-in-the-loop interactions (default: true)

competitions:
  - name: "Franklin Meilenlauf"
    date: "2025-10-12"
    race_type: "Half Marathon"
    priority: "A"
    target_time: "01:40:00"

output:
  directory: "./data"

credentials:
  password: ""  # leave empty for secure interactive input
```

> Tip: The advanced details live inside the `context.planning` text; the system is instruction-following and will respect these constraints.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Mode

**What is HITL?**

When enabled (default), AI agents can pause during analysis or planning to ask you clarifying questions. This ensures the coaching advice addresses your specific situation, preferences, and constraints that might not be captured in your config file.

**Example Interaction:**

```
🤖 I noticed your last bike ran hot on HR compared to your norm. Any context I should know?

👤 Your answer: Yeah, I had terrible nutrition beforehand and just wasn't in good form that day.
```
