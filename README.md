## 📋 Sample Configuration

```yaml
# Athlete Information
athlete:
  name: "John Doe"
  email: "john.doe@example.com"  # Garmin Connect email

# Analysis Context  
context:
  analysis: |
    Coming back from a minor injury. Focusing on base building and
    avoiding high-intensity work for the next 2 weeks.
  planning: |
    Preparing for Olympic distance triathlon in 12 weeks.
    Priority is building aerobic base and improving run endurance.

# Data Extraction Settings
extraction:
  activities_days: 7       # Recent training data
  metrics_days: 14         # Physiological trends  
  ai_mode: "development"   # Analysis depth

# Upcoming Competitions

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

### LangGraph Workflow System
Modern state-based AI orchestration with built-in observability:

```python
# Parallel Analysis Phase
START → [Metrics, Physiology, Activity Data] → Activity Interpreter
                ↓                ↓                    ↓
            Synthesis Agent ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
                ↓
         HTML Formatter → Plot Resolution → END
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **67% Code Reduction** - From 800+ lines to 300 lines vs legacy LangChain
- ✅ **Built-in Observability** - Professional LangSmith monitoring  
- ✅ **Parallel Execution** - Metrics + Physiology agents run simultaneously
- ✅ **Automatic State Management** - Typed state with reducers
- ✅ **Error Recovery** - Node-level handling and retries

### Security Architecture

```
🔐 Local Encryption → 📊 Data Processing → 🤖 AI Analysis → 📋 Report Generation
     (Per-user keys)      (In-memory)        (API calls)      (Local storage)
```

- **Encrypted Credentials** - AES-256 encryption with per-user keys
- **Local Data Storage** - No cloud persistence of personal data
- **Secure API Calls** - Direct LLM provider communication
- **Usage Tracking** - Transparent cost monitoring
